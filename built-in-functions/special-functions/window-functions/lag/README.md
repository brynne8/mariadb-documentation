# LAG

##### MariaDB starting with [10.2.2](/kb/en/mariadb-1022-release-notes/)

The LAG() function was first introduced with other [window functions](/built-in-functions/special-functions/window-functions) in [MariaDB 10.2](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-102/).

## Syntax

```sql
LAG (expr[, offset]) OVER ( 
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression ] 
  < ORDER BY order_list >
)
```

## Description

The <em>LAG</em> function accesses data from a previous row according to the ORDER BY clause without the need for a self-join. The specific row is determined by the <em>offset</em> (default <em>1</em>), which specifies the number of rows behind the current row to use. An offset of <em>0</em> is the current row.

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (pk int primary key, a int, b int, c char(10), d decimal(10, 3), e real);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
 ( 1, 0, 1,    'one',    0.1,  0.001),
 ( 2, 0, 2,    'two',    0.2,  0.002),
 ( 3, 0, 3,    'three',  0.3,  0.003),
 ( 4, 1, 2,    'three',  0.4,  0.004),
 ( 5, 1, 1,    'two',    0.5,  0.005),
 ( 6, 1, 1,    'one',    0.6,  0.006),
 ( 7, 2, NULL, 'n_one',  0.5,  0.007),
 ( 8, 2, 1,    'n_two',  NULL, 0.008),
 ( 9, 2, 2,    NULL,     0.7,  0.009),
 (10, 2, 0,    'n_four', 0.8,  0.010),
 (11, 2, 10,   NULL,     0.9,  NULL);
