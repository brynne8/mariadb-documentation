# FIRST_VALUE

##### MariaDB starting with [10.2.2](/kb/en/mariadb-1022-release-notes/)

The FIRST_VALUE() function was first introduced with other [window functions](/built-in-functions/special-functions/window-functions) in [MariaDB 10.2](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-102/).

## Syntax

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(expr) OVER (
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression ]
  [ ORDER BY order_list ]
) 
```

## Description

`FIRST_VALUE` returns the first result from an ordered set, or NULL if no such result exists.

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  pk int primary key,
  a int,
  b int,
  c char(10),
  d decimal(10, 3),
  e real
);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
( 1, 0, 1,    'one',    0.1,  0.001),
( 2, 0, 2,    'two',    0.2,  0.002),
( 3, 0, 3,    'three',  0.3,  0.003),
( 4, 1, 2,    'three',  0.4,  0.004),
( 5, 1, 1,    'two',    0.5,  0.005),
( 6, 1, 1,    'one',    0.6,  0.006),
( 7, 2, NULL, 'n_one',  0.5,  0.007),
( 8, 2, 1,    'n_two',  NULL, 0.008),
( 9, 2, 2,    NULL,     0.7,  0.009),
(10, 2, 0,    'n_four', 0.8,  0.010),
(11, 2, 10,   NULL,     0.9,  NULL);
