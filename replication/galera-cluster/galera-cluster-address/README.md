# Galera Cluster Address

URL's in [Galera](/kb/en/galera/) take a particular format:

```sql
<schema>://<cluster_address>[?option1=value1[&option2=value2]]
```

## Schema

- `gcomm` - This is the option to use for a working implementation.
- `dummy` - Used for running tests and profiling, does not do any actual replication, and all following parameters are ignored.

## Cluster address

- The cluster address shouldn't be empty like `gcomm://`. This should never be hardcoded into any configuration files.
- To connect the node to an existing cluster, the cluster address should contain the address of any member of the cluster you want to join.
- The cluster address can also contain a comma-separated list of multiple members of the cluster. It is good practice to list all possible members of the cluster, for example `gcomm:<em>&lt;node1 name or ip&gt;,&lt;node2 name or ip2&gt;,&lt;node3 name or ip&gt;</em>`. Alternately if multicast is use put the multicast address instead of the list of nodes. Each member address or multicast address can specify `&lt;node name or ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;` if a non-default port is used.

## Option list

- The [wsrep_provider_options](/kb/en/galera-cluster-system-variables/#wsrep_provider_options) variable is used to set a [list of options](/replication/galera-cluster/wsrep_provider_options/). These parameters can also be provided (and overridden)  as part of the URL. Unlike options provided in a configuration file, they will not endure, and need to be resubmitted with each connection.

A useful option to set is `pc.wait_prim=no` to ensure the server will start running even if it can't determine a primary node. This is useful if all members go down at the same time.

## Port

By default, gcomm listens on all interfaces. The port is either provided in the cluster address, or will default to 4567 if not set.
