# Performance Schema table_lock_waits_summary_by_table Table

##### MariaDB starting with [10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/)

The `table_lock_waits_summary_by_table` table, along with many other new [Performance Schema tables](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/list-of-performance-schema-tables/), was added in [MariaDB 10.0](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-100/).

The `table_lock_waits_summary_by_table` table records table lock waits by table.

You can [TRUNCATE](/sql-statements-structure/sql-statements/table-statements/truncate-table/) the table, which will reset all counters to zero.
