# ColumnStore Rename Table

The RENAME TABLE statement renames one or more ColumnStore tables.

Notes:

- You cannot currently use RENAME TABLE to move a table from one database to another.
- See the ALTER TABLE syntax for an alternate to RENAME table. The following statement renames the <em>orders</em> table:

```sql
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_order;
```

The following statement renames both the <em>orders</em> table and <em>customer</em> table:

```sql
RENAME TABLE orders TO customer_orders,customer TO customers;
```

You may also use RENAME TABLE to swap tables. This example swaps the <em>customer</em> and <em>vendor</em> tables (assuming the <em>temp_table</em>
does not already exist):

```sql
RENAME TABLE customer TO temp_table, vendor TO customer,temp_table to vendor;
```
