## Upgrade

The following procedure outlines upgrading a 1.1.1 ColumnStore install to 1.1.2:

- [1.1.1 RC to 1.1.2 GA upgrade procedure](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/mariadb-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-11-upgrades/mariadb-columnstore-software-upgrade-111-rc-to-112-ga)

Multi version upgrades generally will work using the same procedure however we can't test every possible permutation so you should test your specific scenario outside of production first if you wish to try this (and this is good practice regardless).

## Known issues and limitations

There are a number bugs and known limitations within this version of MariaDB ColumnStore, the most serious of these are listed below.

- [MCOL-271](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-271)  empty string values are treated as NULL. This means you cannot insert empty values into a NOT NULL string column.
- [MCOL-365](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-365): Log files created by load data infile remain in the bulk/data/log and /tmp directories. If storage is a concern these can safely be removed.
- [MCOL-540](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-540) : In a non root Ubuntu install with local query enabled, the PM servers crash and restart on table creation.
- [MCOL-624](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-624) :[MariaDB 10.2](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-102/) WF create MEDIAN, PERCENTILE_CONT and PERCENTILE_DISC Window functions. MariaDB ColumnStore 1.1 was rewritten to use the [MariaDB 10.2](/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-102/) server parser code which does not support the percentile window functions. This will be added in a later release. A median function has been provided instead as part of the User Defined Aggregate Function framework that provides similar functionality or can be adapted to support percentiles other than 0.5.
- [MCOL-631](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-631) :Create table caused primproc crashed for a specific configuration
- [MCOL-643](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-643) :Implement ha_calpont_impl_rnd_pos. Sorting of long text columns may fail.
- [MCOL-695](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-695) :Implement joins between CHAR/VARCHAR and INT columns. ColumnStore now fails more consistently on incompatible join types. Explicit type casts must be used if this error is hit.
- [MCOL-713](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-713) : Some functions return "The maximum row size" error when TEXT/LONGTEXT is used in a table
- [MCOL-912](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-912) : After adding two PMs with gluster, cpimport failed on newly added PMs. The system must be restarted after adding PM modules with data redundancy / gluster storage.
- [MCOL-1083](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-1083) : Crash when using blob column in 2 subqueries.
- The current logging default generates full verbose debug logs. This can be controlled by making logging configuration changes as described [here](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/mariadb-columnstore/managing-columnstore/managing-columnstore-system/columnstore-system-monitoring-configuration).
- While Millisecond and Microsecond storage is supported for datetime, time and timestamp columns, at this time the query results cannot return millisecond and microseconds.
- UTF-8 Limitation
<ul start="1"><li>UTF-8 must be declared at the table level if the instance has been set up with a UTF-8 profile. Tables created with a non-matching character set will yield indeterminate results. 
</li><li>Viewing SQL output should be done using client software that supports UTF-8 character sets. 
</li><li>UTF-8 characters are not supported in object names. 
</li></ul>
- Known security issues and fixes are documented [here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/security-vulnerabilities-mariadb-columnstore/).
