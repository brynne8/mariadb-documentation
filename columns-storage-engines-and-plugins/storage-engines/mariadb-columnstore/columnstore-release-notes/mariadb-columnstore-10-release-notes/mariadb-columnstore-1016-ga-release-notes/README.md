## Upgrade

The following procedure outlines upgrading a 1.0.15 ColumnStore install to 1.0.16:

- [1.0.15 GA to 1.0.16 upgrade procedure](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/mariadb-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-columnstore/mariadb-columnstore-10-upgrades/mariadb-columnstore-software-upgrade-1015-to-1016/)
Multi version upgrades generally will work using the same procedure however we can't test every possible permutation so you should test your specific scenario outside of production first if you wish to try this (and this is good practice regardless).

## Known issues and limitations

There are a number bugs and known limitations within this version of MariaDB ColumnStore, the most serious of these are listed below.

- [MCOL-73](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-73): Wide table formatted display causes frontend to return error
<ul start="1"><li>MariaDB ColumnStore supports wide tables storage
</li><li>Displaying the query results on a large number of columns without formatting the column works
</li><li>Displaying the query results on a large number of columns with formatting causes error at MariaDB Server level
</li></ul>
- [MCOL-271](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-271)  empty string values are treated as NULL. This means you cannot insert empty values into a NOT NULL string column.
- [MCOL-364](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-364): In a multi UM configuration where the default storage engine has been set to columnstore replicated tables are not created as columnstore tables. Avoid overriding the default storage engine and specify engine=columnstore on all table DDL.
- [MCOL-365](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-365): Log files created by load data infile remain in the bulk/data/log and /tmp directories. If storage is a concern these can safely be removed.
- [MCOL-463](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-463) : gluster storage option in installer fails with an error. The installer option to install optimized for gluster storage will fail with an error. Manually set up gluster volumes can be used with the 'External' storage option.
- [MCOL-540](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-540) : In a non root Ubuntu install with local query enabled, the PM servers crash and restart on table creation.

- The current logging default generates full verbose debug logs. This can be controlled by making logging configuration changes as described [here](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/mariadb-columnstore/managing-columnstore/managing-columnstore-system/columnstore-system-monitoring-configuration/).
- While Millisecond and Microsecond storage is supported for datetime, time and timestamp columns, at this time the query results cannot return millisecond and microseconds.
- UTF-8 Limitation
<ul start="1"><li>UTF-8 must be declared at the table level if the instance has been set up with a UTF-8 profile. Tables created with a non-matching character set will yield indeterminate results. 
</li><li>Viewing SQL output should be done using client software that supports UTF-8 character sets. 
</li><li>UTF-8 characters are not supported in object names. 
</li></ul>
- Known security issues and fixes are documented [here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/security-vulnerabilities-mariadb-columnstore/).
