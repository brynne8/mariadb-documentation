## Known Issues and Limitations

There are a number bugs and known limitations within this beta version of MariaDB ColumnStore, the most serious of these are listed below.

- [MCOL-73](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-73)): Wide table formatted display causes frontend to return error
<ul start="1"><li>MariaDB ColumnStore supports wide tables storage
</li><li>Displaying the query results on a large number of columns without formatting the column works
</li><li>Displaying the query results on a large number of columns with formatting causes error at MariaDB Server level
</li></ul>
- [MCOL-271](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-271)  empty string values are treated as NULL. This means you cannot insert empty values into a NOT NULL string column.
- [MCOL-364](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-364): In a multi UM configuration where the default storage engine has been set to columnstore replicated tables are not created as columnstore tables. Avoid overriding the default storage engine and specify engine=columnstore on all table DDL.
- [MCOL-365](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-365): Log files created by load data infile remain in the bulk/data/log and /tmp directories. If storage is a concern these can safely be removed.
- [MCOL-421](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-421): If a password was set for the root localhost user in the prior installed version then upgrade will fail. The workaround is to clear the password temporarily prior to the upgrade and reapply after the upgrade is complete.
- The current logging default generates full verbose debug logs. This can be controlled by making logging configuration changes as described [here](/columns-storage-engines-and-plugins/storage-engines/mariadb-columnstore/managing-columnstore/managing-columnstore-system/columnstore-system-monitoring-configuration).
- While Millisecond and Microsecond storage is supported for datetime, time and timestamp columns, at this time the query results cannot return millisecond and microseconds.
- UTF-8 Limitation
<ul start="1"><li>UTF-8 must be declared at the table level if the instance has been set up with a UTF-8 profile. Tables created with a non-matching character set will yield indeterminate results. 
</li><li>Viewing SQL output should be done using client software that supports UTF-8 character sets. 
</li><li>UTF-8 characters are not supported in object names. 
</li></ul>
- Known security issues and fixes are documented [here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/security-vulnerabilities-mariadb-columnstore/).
